## Research (Ongoing)
1. Machine Learning & Satellite Communications
   [ Doopler Collision & Machine Learning ](../Satellite_ML.png)
- I have Employed various Machine Learning algorithms to mitigate the errors and complexities involved in Satellite Communications.
- My research abstract on this project was shortlisited for National Scinece Symposium organised by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).
- Doppler collision is one of the major concers in satellite communications.
- Processed 30 days of satellite Data. Each observation data file has 86,400 data entries.
- The file consists of information like the satellite's position, velocity, acceleration, Doppler data, frequencies and many other meta data.
- Had to employ algorithms like KNN, Random forest, Voting regressor, Linear regression to analyse and predict the potential time at which doppler collisions would occur.
